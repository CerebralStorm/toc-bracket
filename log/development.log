AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The show action could not be found for the :set_league
callback on LeagueUsersController, but it is listed in the controller's

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The edit action could not be found for the :set_user
callback on UsersController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.
